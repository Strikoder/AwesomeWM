# AwesomeWM Minimal Setup
Welcome to my AwesomeWM configuration repository! This setup is tailored for a dual-monitor setup and includes a range of gadgets that enhance the AwesomeWM experience. 
I've recently transitioned to using Linux and Neovim (big thanks to ThePrimeagen! ❤️). So plz do not judge me, as I'm still exploring and learning :3

## Getting Started
To use this configuration:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repo to make your own copy.

2. **Move Files to Awesome Directory**:
   - Navigate to your `.config` directory.
   - If an `awesome` directory doesn't exist, create it.
   - Move the files from this repo into the `.config/awesome` directory.

## Configuration Details

This setup is designed for a dual-monitor arrangement:

- **Primary Monitor**: Vertical 1600x2560
- **Secondary Monitor**: Horizontal 1920x1080

**Note for Single Monitor Users**: If you're using a single monitor, you'll need to edit and omit certain parts of the configuration. Look for comments marked with `---- 2 monitor` to identify these sections.

## Required Packages

For the full experience, install the following packages:

``` bash
sudo apt install neofetch htop cmatrix neovim maim
```
